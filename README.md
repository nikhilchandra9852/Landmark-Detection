# Landmark-Detection
Image recognition and retrieval is a useful yet challenging task in computer vision. Landmark recognition predicts landmark labels directly from image pixels and Landmark retrieval finds similar images in a large database. The proposed project is done in two modules. The first module builds a model that recognizes the correct landmark (if any) in a dataset of challenging test images which helps people better understand and organize their photo collections. In this project, a dataset containing historic monuments of India of around 100 classes is created. In the first module, i.e, Landmark recognition, the module is again divided into three sub-modules. Initially, the dataset is divided into training, testing, and validation data. Data augmentation is performed on training and validation data in the dataset. ResNet50 algorithm is used here to train the dataset. After that, a sample image is given to the ResNet50 model for prediction and the model gives the top 10 labels of the sample image. Consider two images for each label from the training dataset, Apply DELF on these images and sample image. The inliers are calculated for these images using the Ransac algorithm. Image label which has a good number of inliers with sample image is the landmark of that sample image. This is especially important for query images containing landmarks, which account for a large portion of what people like to photograph.
